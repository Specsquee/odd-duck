## What is Odd Duck.

Odd duck is a voting contest giving a user an option of three potential products to choose what they are most interested in and pits them against eachother with various choices. After 25 items are picked a graph can be generated showing how many times an item was viewed and how many times it was picked. This is for the company to help figure out what potentially is the best item to move to market.
